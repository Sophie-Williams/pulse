//The values in this file are RGB values, which means that each number (from 0 to 255) represents the % of the colours red, green and blue will be
//blended together. Examples: Black = 0,0,0. White = 255,255,255. Red = 255,0,0. Pink = 255,0,255. Orange = 255,160,0. google "rgb colour codes" for tables
//of colours and their numbers
//note[1-7] each note on the frame
//light[1-7] the glow that appears when a key is held
//burst[1-7] the animation on successful hit
