Pulse: a rhythm game using OpenTK (OpenGL wrapper), C#, BASS.NET, and Lua
====
Pulse was actively developed from 2011-2012 and in its final stages had online capabilities. A summary of some of its features are as follows:

-  integrated with IRC (people in game could chat with people connecting to the irc channel via traditional clients and vice versa), 
-  a custom web site (that allowed users to submit custom content [called charts, which contained a song usually in mp3 form and corresponding user created input data that would generate the notes falling down the screen], showed chart submissions, and scoreboards for each of these user submitted charts), 
-  a forum,
-  a custom server,
-  and a high level of customizability (users could replace visual elements of the user interface as they see fit and distribute these customizations as 'skins). Used lua as well

 However, due to unfortunate circumstances, the server and the corresponding services it hosted (web site/forums, irc, the pulse server) were shut down and deleted
 
I've been trying to get Pulse running on my new computer, but it seems the Lua interpreter we're using has some dependency that my old computer somehow satisfied but my new one cannot, even after installing the required C++ redistributable.
